Areas of Concern
=================
Our investigation focuses on the follow areas: 
* [Circuits](#circuits)
* [Proof Generation](#proof-generation)
* [Hardware Compatibility](#hardware-compatibility)
* [Tools](#tools)

## Circuits
- writing circuits for mobile devices, such as Andriod and iOS 
- Recursive proof support in circom etc. 
- Oracle and balance verification in circuit 

## Proof Generation 
- Practical and efficient proof generation on browsers and compatibility 
- Proof generation latency range based on devices 

## Hardware Compatibility 
- Snark library compatibility for M1 chips 
- Hardware wallet SDK function enrichment 

## Tools 
- Proof performance estimation, for example, estimate memory consumption per constraint to allocate enough resources
